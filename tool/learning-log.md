* To first start off, I used the [w3school DJango website](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)
* Before we start, we had to decide whether or not we wanted to make an app or website using Django. Ultimately, we chose that we wanted to make an app.
* Since DJango uses python, it was a challenge to learn something that I don't have any experience in using.
