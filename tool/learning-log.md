* To first start off, I used the [w3school DJango website](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)
* Before we start, we had to decide whether or not we wanted to make an app or website using Django. Ultimately, we chose that we wanted to make an app.
* Since DJango uses python, it was a challenge to learn something that I don't have any experience in using.

* [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIg40xs9e4)
* Django is a powerful web framer for Python
* Has been used to build websites like instagram, spotify, and dropbox
* When in Python, use  `pip 20.2.3 from c:\python39\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.9)` to download django into it
* `django-admin startproject projectName` - creates a project directory with files inside it
