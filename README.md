# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Grace Zhu and Vivian Zheng**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to work together with Vivian to use the tool **Django** in order to make our **flashcard website**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* You can add as many flashcards as you can
* You can create a account to login to the website and the account will be remembered
* The website can adjust to any screen size to look good
##### CONS
* Others can enter the website and see the previous user's flashcards
* The flashcards will be in order and cannot be mixed around
* besides creating a flashcard, there is barely any content
