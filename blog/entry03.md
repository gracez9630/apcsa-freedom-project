# Entry 3
##### 2/5/24

Since the last blog entry, I continued to watch the Python Django Tutorial, this time watching part 3 and 4. Also, I looked at other sites to find any tips about Django being:

* [tips for Django](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/7-tips-and-more-to-ensure-a-successful-django-project-331a8d5746a3)
* [Django philosophies](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/misc/design-philosophies/)
* [Django packages](https://djangopackages.org/)
* [Django Tutorial for custom user model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)

These helped to figure out some tips or small info when it comes to Django.

Still, the main focus that I put with was [Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App Part 3 - Templates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDwdMDQ8oX4&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=3) and [Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App Part 4 - Admin Page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PkNiYlkkjo&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p&index=4) as they were both a continuation of part 2.

Part 3 was the introduction of templates. It lets me create html files and connect it to views.py to make a whole webpage.
