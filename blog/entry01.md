For our freedom project, my partner Vivian and I decided that we wanted to create a slide card app/website. Essentially, it is going to be used to help students review their vocabulary and study for exams. They can choose to add on to their list of flashcards and make quizzes for studying. The whole goal of this freedom project was to create something that can help students using the tool that we chose. For the tool, Vivian and I decided to use DJango because it was recommended as something to be used to make our slide card app/website. The sites I used to learn my tool, I used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/) and a [20 minute DJango tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIg40xs9e4).

One of the biggest challenge I had when getting trying to get into DJango was the fact that I had to use Python. Since I have never used Python before, I couldn't understand what majority of what many guides were talking about. This was a problem as I was basically going blind in terms of learning my tools.
