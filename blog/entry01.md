For our freedom project, my partner Vivian and I decided that we wanted to create a slide card app/website. Essentially, it is going to be used to help students review their vocabulary and study for exams. They can choose to add on to their list of flashcards and make quizzes for studying. The whole goal of this freedom project was to create something that can help students using the tool that we chose. For the tool, Vivian and I decided to use DJango because it was recommended as something to be used to make our slide card app/website. The sites I used to learn my tool, I used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/django/) and a [20 minute DJango tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGIg40xs9e4). I also made sure to use replit to tinker around with DJango.

One of the biggest challenge I had when getting into DJango was the fact that I had to use Python. Since I have never used Python before, I couldn't understand what majority of what many guides were talking about. This was a problem as I was basically going blind in terms of learning my tools. Still, it didn't stop me from trying to gain a understanding of how I can use DJango. I watched videos about DJango, hoping that by hearing from others, it can help me learn about how DJango can be use for my freedom project.

I made sure to fully use the skills of attention to detail, embracing failure, growth mindset. These skills were essential for me as they helped me in learning about my tool. Attention to detail makes it so that I pay a close attention to the websites I used and try and gain as much information as I can, even if it was little. Embracing failure helps me to understand that every mistakes I've made is a way to help my grow, as I learn from each mistakes I made when learning my tool. Growth mindset allowed me to stay assured of my decision to learn DJango, it lets me to look for help, especially when it comes to finding videos that can help me learn about my tool. With these skills, I can just barely grasp a hold on what DJango is and how I may be able to use it for my freedom project. For the upcoming future, I plan to continue to find more websites that can help me gain a better understanding about DJango and also form a way to use it for my freedom project.
